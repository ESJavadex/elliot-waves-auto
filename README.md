This is a Python-based web application for **Elliott Wave analysis** of financial markets. It detects wave structures (impulses and corrections), projects future price zones using **Fibonacci retracements/extensions**, and provides **trade setup recommendations** with entry, stop-loss, and take-profit levels.
